        <h4>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES</h4>
Except as otherwise provided herein, Scantron will only disclose your Personal Data to Third Parties who reasonably need to know such data for the scope of the initial transaction and not for other purposes.
<div class="spacer10"></div>
         As such, Scantron may provide your Personal Data to Third Parties that act as agents, consultants, and contractors to perform tasks on behalf of and under our instructions (such as security service providers, cloud storage providers, professional test administration sites, fulfillment service providers, and the customer with which we are providing services under the initial transaction). For example, Scantron engages Third Parties located in the EU to collect, store and process your Personal Data in their EU facilities on behalf of Scantron in the course of providing services to you. Scantron ensures that such Third Parties have contractually agreed to use your Personal Data only for the purposes for which they have been engaged by Scantron, and they must either:
    <ol>
        <li>Comply with the Privacy Shield principles or another mechanism permitted by the applicable EU & Swiss data protection law(s) for transfers and processing of Personal Data;</li>
        <li>or agree to provide adequate protections for the Personal Data that are no less protective than those set out in this Policy.</li>
    </ol>

Scantron also may disclose your Personal Data for other purposes or to other Third Parties when you have expressly consented to or requested such disclosure. Additionally, Scantron may be required to disclose your Personal Data in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Scantron is liable for appropriate onward transfers of personal data to Third Parties.

        <h4>ACCESS</h4>

You have the right to contact Scantron to determine what, if any, of your Personal Data has been transmitted and stored on databases located in the US, and to determine whether such Personal Data is accurate or relevant for the purposes for which was collected. Upon request and as required by the Privacy Shield Principles, Scantron will permit you to access your Personal Data in order to correct, amend, or delete such information. Such requests are handled by filling out an Inquiry Form and e-mailing to EU-Support@scantron.com

In particular, all connections to and from the EU-based website are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Despite these precautions, please be advised that no data security safeguards guarantee 100% security.
