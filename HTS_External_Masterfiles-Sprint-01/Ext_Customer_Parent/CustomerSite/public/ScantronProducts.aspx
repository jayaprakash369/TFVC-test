    <h1>Exclusive Support for Scantron Equipment</h1>
    <p>Scantron Technology Solutions is the provider of maintenance and replacement parts for Scantron scanning equipment.  We offer four levels of OMR maintenance services: Onsite, Enhanced Depot, Central Exchange, and Depot.</p>

    <h4>Onsite</h4>
    <p>Our onsite solution offers the highest level of service to ensure maximum uptime of your scanner. Should you experience an equipment failure, you simply call the Scantron Technology Solutions Contact Center to place a service request, and a local technician will arrive onsite to diagnose and resolve your hardware issues.</p>

    <h4>Enhanced Depot</h4>
    <p>Our enhanced depot maintenance service features a double swap of scanners. When a scanning problem arises, simply call our toll free help-desk and a technical support expert will assess the situation. Once the problem is determined, we immediately send a replacement scanner via next day air service so it will arrive the following morning. You put the new scanner in place and return the failed unit to Scantron Technology Solutions for repair. After the repair is completed, we will return your original scanner and you will then return the loaner unit to Scantron Technology Solutions.</p>

    <h4>Central Exchange</h4>
    <p>This service features the advance exchange of scanners. When a hardware problem arises with your equipment, you call the Scantron Technology Solutions Contact Center for diagnosis. If the cause is a
    hardware failure, Scantron Technology Solutions will ship you a replacement scanner and when you receive it, you simply return the failed unit to us. </p>

    <h4>Depot</h4>
    <p>Depot maintenance is an excellent option for the customer who wants the assurance of full coverage but does not require same day service. When your scanner requires service, simply ship the unit to Scantron Technology Solutions' depot via the shipping method of your choice. Upon receipt of the failed scanner in Omaha, the unit will be turned around in three business days.</p>
