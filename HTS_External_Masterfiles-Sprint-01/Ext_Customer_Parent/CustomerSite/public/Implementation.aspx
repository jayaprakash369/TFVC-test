    <h1>Tested and Proven Methodologies</h1>
    <p>Today's organizations face increased demands on their network infrastructures, requiring higher levels of performance, availability, and mobility to take advantage of new technologies.  The changes needed to meet the demands of new hardware and/or software can be overwhelming and complex.</p>

<p>Scantron Technology Solutions provides the expertise to help organizations build network infrastructures and implement the IT changes while maximizing the value of their existing network environments.  Our Network Implementation Services include <b>network design and analysis, hardware procurement, staging and configuration, testing and onsite installation.</b></p>

<h4>Network Design and Analysis</h4>
<p>One of our highly trained Pre-Sales Engineers will visit with you to discover your current environment and to analyze it in regards to your growth plans and goals for your organization.  Many times that involves evaluating your current network and equipment in anticipation of installing new hardware and core software packages.  Discovering how to best re-use existing equipment and to plan a smooth install with minimal interruption to day to day business activities allows you to make informed decisions about your organization and leave the installation to Scantron Technology Solutions.</p>

<p>You will be presented with a project plan and quote for all the components of your installation, including hardware, operating systems, software and peripherals as well as labor.</p>

<h4>Hardware Procurement</h4>
<p>Our vast network of suppliers and vendors allows us a great selection of hardware, software and peripherals at very competitive prices.</p>

<h4>Staging and Configuration</h4>
<p>An important part of making your installation experience a positive one is making sure that all the hardware required to finalize your network design is there when the Installation Technicians arrive. Nothing is more frustrating than the extra time and expense added to a project because of missing hardware and/or peripherals.</p>
<p>Your order is assembled and pre-configured to save valuable on-site installation time. When your order arrives you can be confident that your project is on track.</p>

<h4>Onsite Installation</h4>
<p>Your Project Coordinator will work with you to develop a schedule that brings together your project timeline with the arrival of parts and personnel to complete the installation.</p>
<p>Many times things change after the initial design and plan or there are additional tasks that need to be completed outside of the original plan.  Our experienced installers will make sure the additional tasks do not interfere with the original design and work with you to complete the entire installation.</p>

<h4>Hardware and Network Maintenance</h4>
    <p>Included with the custom proposal created for you by your Implementation Services Representative will be a hardware maintenance proposal to make sure your hardware continues to run at its optimum level.</p>
    <p>Upon your request, Scantron Technology Solutions can also provide you with an <asp:HyperLink ID="hlAffiance1" runat="server" Text="affianceSUITE" NavigateUrl="~/public/affianceSuite.aspx" Target="affianceSuite" /> proposal to ensure the optimal up time possible for your network and computing equipment.</p>
    <p>Basic hardware maintenance provides a reactive service. When a piece of equipment fails your phone call will trigger a visit by one of our highly trained Field Service Technicians to remedy the problem. With the addition of an <asp:HyperLink ID="hlAffiance2" runat="server" Text="affianceSUITE" NavigateUrl="~/public/affianceSuite.aspx" Target="affianceSuite" /> agreement, our Support Center in Omaha will be actively kept up-to-date with health information about your network allowing us the opportunity to see an issue before it becomes a problem. We have found that between 40 to 70% of the service calls are resolved by our Support Center before the customer knows there is a problem.</p>
