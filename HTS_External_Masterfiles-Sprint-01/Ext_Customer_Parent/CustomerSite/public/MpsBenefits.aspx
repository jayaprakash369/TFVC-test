        <h1>Reduce Total Cost of Ownership</h1>

        <p><b>Value for Our Customers</b></p>
        
        <p>Organizations of all sizes are seeing significant benefits from implementing a managed print services strategy. By outsourcing the document management process our customers are able to achieve a significant reduction in costs.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

        <div class="staticSubColor1">Device Management/Asset Management</div>
        <p>Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return on Investment (ROI) are increasingly important to organizations, especially in today's tight budgetary environment. Scantron Technology Solutions will work with you to keep serial numbers and swapped units properly documented and your asset tracking and inventory up to date. Additionally, this information will be available for you to view within the Scantron Technology Solutions MPowerPrint web portal.</p>
    
        <div class="staticSubColor1">Communication</div>
        <p>Knowing "when, who, and where" is very important when managing remote users. Scantron Technology Solutions, as your support partner, understands this and will work to provide your helpdesk and end-users with timely (and automated) updates regarding estimated onsite arrival times, toner and parts shipments and many other facets of your open and closed calls. </p>

        <div class="staticSubColor1">Proactive versus Reactive Approach to Support</div>
        <p>Scantron Technology Solutions uses cutting-edge, enterprise-wide print infrastructure monitoring software to provide information about device usage, pending toner replenishment and potential service issues. This information will allow for dedicated Scantron Technology Solutions service staff to proactively contact your helpdesk, order replacement toner, open service tickets, and troubleshoot failures. </p>

        <div class="staticSubColor1">Local Expertise for All Locations </div>
        <p>Scantron Technology Solutions has a nationwide Field Service Technician presence, allowing your organization to contact one telephone number (or utilize one secure web portal) for all printer maintenance issues, regardless of what site requires assistance. We guarantee consistent, high quality service and locally stocked parts at each location.</p>

        <div class="staticSubColor1">Fixed Costs Involved </div>
        <p>With the service agreement, all parts, toner, labor, shipping and support are factored into the cost per page. For budgeting and account payable purposes, our customers find it easier to have no surprise costs, especially when it comes to the high cost of technical labor, consumables and parts.</p>

        <div class="staticSubColor1">Accessibility to Record of Service Calls </div>
        <p>Scantron Technology Solutions offers <asp:LinkButton ID="LinkButton1" runat="server" PostBackUrl="~/private/shared/Menu.aspx">ServiceCOMMAND®</asp:LinkButton> with all our service agreements – the ability for end-users to track all service calls from start to finish. This will increase help desk and end-user productivity by maintaining constant status updates of your service request for all to see. </p>
